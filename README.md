Skin Disease Classification and Severity Detection using CNN and HAM10000 Dataset

This project uses deep learning models to classify seven types of skin diseases and detect their severity (mild, moderate, or severe). Trained on the HAM10000 dataset, the system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is deployed via a user-friendly Streamlit web application. It aims to assist in early dermatological diagnostics and promote accessible skin health monitoring.

âœ… Key Features
Skin Disease Classification: Detects and classifies dermatological conditions using a CNN trained on HAM10000.

Severity Detection: Automatically estimates the severity of the lesion based on visual features.

Deep Learning Framework: Built with TensorFlow/Keras and trained using robust data preprocessing and augmentation.

Streamlit Interface: Intuitive web-based interface for uploading images and getting predictions.

Performance Monitoring: Displays loss/accuracy graphs and prediction confidence.

ðŸ“š Dataset: HAM10000
The HAM10000 (Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images) dataset contains high-resolution dermoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions. Itâ€™s widely used for skin disease classification research.
